## New files, new paths

By default, on Windows, paths are case insensitive :

Best practices for new paths are thus :

- no space(s)
- no upper case(s)
- no special characters
- snake case, like so : `this_is_my_new_path/to_another_directory/with_my_file.ext`


## GIT

Golden rules :

- `commit`, `pull-rebase`, `push`
- commits as :
	- added : What was added.
	- modified : What was modified.
	- deleted : What was deleted.

## .gitignore

> A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected.
