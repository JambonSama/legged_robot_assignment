\section{Introduction}

The objective of this assignment is to construct metrics and find optimal parameters for the controller, using testing weights and an objective speed. We chose to give the same weight to the effort and the target speed, as nothing contrary to this was indicated, and we settled for a target speed of $0.7$ since the observed mean speed for the initial parameters was around $0.4$.
