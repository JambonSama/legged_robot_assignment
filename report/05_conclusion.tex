\section{Conclusion}

This mini-project allowed us to implement or at least try to several controllers, including a virtual constraints and virtual model ones, while not quite succeeding for a reinforcement learning one.
Because we spent so much time on reinforcement learning, and because the objective function for the virtual model controller was quite hard to design, not all the goals could be met.
In particular, only one gait was optimized for for the virtual model controller, and the one obtained is not very human-like, to say the least.
It is also to be noted that designing an objective function and optimizing it is a very difficult task.
