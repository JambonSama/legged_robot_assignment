\section{Conclusion}

While the objective of creating a robust controller for a bipedal robot was not fully completed, this mini-project allowed us to explore a variety of controller and yielded a few results when not accounting for the saturation of the motor.
Further experimentation would be needed to achieve robust control, capable of withstanding internal and external perturbations. Furthermore, a combination of Reinforcement Learning and virtual model control could be explored, as both can be used together to achieve control of a robot executing various tasks depending on the situation.
